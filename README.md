# bootstrap-and-permutation-test
The repository is part of my assignment during the course "Computational Statistics". In this assignment, we discussed the concept of bootstrap and permutation tests through a dataset about military veterans in the US. 
The data overview is as follow:

The increased suicide rates among United States military veterans is a known phenomenon. News21 published data on the yearly suicide rates both of veterans and civilians for each of the 50 US states. Here we will consider the veteran suicide rate only for the years 2005 and 2011. This is the average number of suicide deaths per 100,000 people in each state's veteran population. The data you need can be found in VetSuicides_2005.csv and VetSuicides_2011.csv; you will need the variable vet_rate. Interest is in testing the hypothesis that the mean suicide rate in 2011 is larger than in 2005.
